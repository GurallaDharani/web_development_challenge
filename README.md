I designed a multi-page website using HTML and CSS, here’s a step-by-step guide creating a multi-page website:

1. Project Setup
•	Create a Project Folder: Create a folder on your computer to hold all your project files.
•	File Structure: Inside this folder, create subfolders for your HTML files, CSS files, and any other assets (like images, JavaScript files, etc.).

2. Basic HTML Structure
Create the main HTML files for your pages. For example:
•	index.html (Home Page)
•	about.html (About Page)
•	contact.html (Contact Page)

3. CSS Styling
Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css) in the css folder and link it to your HTML files.

4. Adding Content to Each Page
For each HTML file, add content relevant to the page. For example, index.html might have a welcome message and some introductory text, while about.html might include information about you or your company.

5. Navigation Links
Ensure that the navigation links in the <nav> element correctly link to the respective pages (index.html, about.html, contact.html). This allows users to navigate between pages seamlessly.

6. Responsiveness
Use media queries in your CSS file to make your website responsive.

7. Testing and Debugging
•	Cross-Browser Testing: Make sure your website looks good in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
•	Device Testing: Check your website on various devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones) to ensure it’s responsive.
By following these steps, you should be able to create a simple, responsive multi-page website using HTML and CSS.
